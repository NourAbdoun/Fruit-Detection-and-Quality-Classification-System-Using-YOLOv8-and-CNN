# Fruit-Detection-and-Quality-Classification-System-Using-YOLOv8-and-CNN
This project presents an integrated system for detecting various types of fruits and assessing their quality. Utilizing the YOLOv8 architecture for object detection and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for quality classification, this system offers a comprehensive solution for fruit analysis.

# Features
Fruit Detection: Employs YOLOv8 to accurately detect and classify 12 different fruit categories from images.
Quality Classification: Utilizes a CNN-based model to classify the detected fruits as either Fresh or Rotten.
Integrated System: Combines fruit detection and quality classification into a unified workflow for efficient and effective fruit assessment.
